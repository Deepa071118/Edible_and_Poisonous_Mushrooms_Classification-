# Edible_and_Poisonous_Mushrooms_Classification
## Overview

This project aims to classify mushrooms into edible and poisonous categories based on the image dataset. The classification model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze images of mushrooms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled images of mushrooms. It is important to ensure the dataset is balanced and representative of both classes.The dataset contains 272 images of both edible and posinous images making a total of 544 images.
